## Booking System

1. Follow the link to the google group that you got in the automatic group email, just now.
2. On a PC, you'll be taken to the google group welcome page with all the info. (On a mobile device, open the first message in list, for that.)
3. Follow the booking system registration link. There, you'll need to enter your own email address and phone number, upon your first booking. Make the booking system site your favorite/bookmark. On a phone, create a desktop shortcut for future convenience.
4. When you come back the first time after that and are asked for a password, click 'Reset password' on the login screen and follow instructions for creating a password.

After that, it's a breeze. Let me know if you get stuck.

5. Take time to learn the (few but important) rules, see link on the welcome page.
